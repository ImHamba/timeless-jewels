## Updates to new leagues

Whenever a new league is coming, the passive tree might get updated.
**But** it is not guaranteed to contain correct data until a game download is available.

Specifically, this project depends on the following data tables:

* Alternate Passive Additions
* Alternate Passive Skills
* Passive Skills
* Stats
* Translations
